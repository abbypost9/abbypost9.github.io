      <description>The Nebraska women’s basketball team had a season unlike any of its recent years. Many deemed it “special” with the success they had. Starting the year off with a 12-0 record, Nebraska had built up its confidence heading into Big Ten play. Led by Amy Williams the Huskers completed their season 24-9 with a trip to the NCAA tournament as an 8th seed. One thing the Husker team couldn’t mark off of its list of accomplishments was making it into the AP Top 25 Poll.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
